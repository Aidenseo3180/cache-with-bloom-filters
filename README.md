# cache-with-bloom-filters
These are implementations of standard bloom filter, counting bloom filter, and breadth bloom filter using Python.  
This is done to mimic the behavior of caching and find the best algorithm to use.  
These bloom filters have been used to determine the false positive rate(number of websites that it caches when it shouldn't) and the memory usage.
